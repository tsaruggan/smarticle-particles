# Smarticle Particles
by Saruggan Thiruchelvan (https://github.com/tsaruggan)

This project is inspired by the book, Nature of Code by the legendary Daniel Shiffman.

Smarticle Particles is an implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve an ideal path. The particles mimic the complex evolutionary processes of biological organisms. Based on their performance, particles enter a mating pool where their DNA (in this case, their acceleration patterns) are crossed-over and mutated with other particles to produce the next generation of particles. Manipulating parameters and introducing obstacles can greatly influence the effectiveness of the particles in solving the ideal path.
